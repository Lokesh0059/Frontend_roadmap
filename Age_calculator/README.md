# Age Calculator

A modern, responsive age calculator that uses the Luxon date/time library and Flatpickr datepicker to calculate your exact age in years, months, and days.

## Features

- ✅ **Custom Datepicker**: Uses Flatpickr instead of the default HTML date picker
- ✅ **Accurate Calculations**: Powered by Luxon for precise date/time operations
- ✅ **Detailed Results**: Shows years, months, days, total days lived, total hours lived, and next birthday
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Validates birth dates to ensure they are realistic and in the past
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- ✅ **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to system dark mode preference
- ✅ **Accessible**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility
- ✅ **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation and error messages

## Technologies Used

- **Luxon**: For accurate date and time calculations
- **Flatpickr**: Custom date picker (light and dependency-free)
- **Webpack**: Module bundler for managing dependencies
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox and Grid
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: No framework dependencies

## Project Structure

```
Age_Calculator/
├── src/
│   ├── index.html         # Main HTML structure
│   ├── index.js          # Main JavaScript application
│   └── style.css         # Styling and responsive design
├── dist/                 # Compiled output (generated by webpack)
├── package.json          # NPM dependencies and scripts
├── webpack.config.js     # Webpack configuration
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Age_Calculator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install:
   - `luxon`: Date/time library for age calculations
   - `flatpickr`: Custom datepicker component
   - Webpack and related tools for building and development

## Usage

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
npm start
```

This will:
- Start a local development server on `http://localhost:8080`
- Automatically open the app in your browser
- Enable hot module reloading for instant updates

Alternatively, you can use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

Build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist/` folder ready for deployment.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Select Your Birth Date**:
   - Click on the input field
   - A calendar picker (Flatpickr) will appear
   - Navigate to your birth date and click to select
   - You can also type the date in the format shown

2. **Calculate Age**:
   - Click the "Calculate Age" button
   - Your age will be displayed in years, months, and days

3. **View Detailed Information**:
   - Birth date (formatted)
   - Total days lived
   - Total hours lived
   - Your next birthday and how many days until then

4. **Reset**:
   - Click "Calculate Another Age" to reset and try again

## Validation

The app validates:
- ✅ Birth date is selected
- ✅ Birth date is in the correct format
- ✅ Birth date is in the past (not a future date)
- ✅ Birth date is reasonable (1900 or later, not more than 150 years ago)

Error messages provide clear guidance if validation fails.

## Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the CSS gradient colors in `src/style.css`:

```css
body {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
}
```

### Adjusting Date Range

In `src/index.js`, modify the datepicker configuration:

```javascript
flatpickr(this.birthdatePicker, {
    yearRange: [1900, today.getFullYear()], // Change year range here
    // ... other options
});
```

### Adding More Statistics

Add new calculation methods in the `AgeCalculator` class and display them in the results section.

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support (iOS 11+)
- Mobile browsers: Full responsive support

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- ARIA labels for form inputs
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus states for all interactive elements
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Works with screen readers

## Performance Optimization

- Webpack bundles and minifies code for production
- CSS is optimized and inlined
- JavaScript dependencies are minimal
- Lazy loading of datepicker only when needed

## Troubleshooting

### Port 8080 already in use

If port 8080 is busy, modify `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
port: 3000, // Change to any available port
```

### Dependencies not installing

Clear npm cache and reinstall:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Datepicker not showing

Ensure Flatpickr CSS is properly imported in `src/index.js`:

```javascript
import 'flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.css';
```
